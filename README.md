Real-Time Fires with Hunt Areas
=======
This application displays real-time fire information from MODIS Fire Detections and USGS Active Fire Perimeters alongside the most recent Fire Emergency Area Closures for Idaho based on InciWeb Closures (http://www.inciweb.org/state/closures/13).</p>

Hunt boundaries for Controlled Hunts, Game Management Units and Elk Zones may be added by selecting a hunt from the left-hand menu.  For more layers and options visit the Idaho Fish and Game Huntplanner MapCenter (http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/ifwis/huntplanner/mapcenter).

Background terrain maps, road maps and aerial imagery may be interchanged by toggling the map dropdown in the upper-right.
